# Pig Game
##### A simple game for learning DOM manipulation and events


GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND       score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After     that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game

## Change [Pig Game]() to follow this rule:

Add another dice to the game, so that there are two dices now. The player looses his current score when one of them is a 1. (Hint: you will need CSS to position the second dice, so take a look at the CSS code for the first one.)
